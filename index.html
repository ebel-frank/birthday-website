                <p>You are the most joyful and the sweetest 
                    sista I have ever known! We might not 
                    have hugged each other or shaken hands, 
                    but I have always felt the sweet bond of 
                    friendship we share. I really look forward
                    to meeting you in person someday in future.</p>
                <p>Stay safe and have an awesome birthday. May all 
                    your wishes come true!</p>
