                    <p>You are the most joyful and the sweetest 
                        sista I have ever known! We might not 
                        have hugged each other or shaken hands, 
                        but I have always felt the sweet bond of 
                        friendship we share. I really look forward
                        to meeting you in person someday in future.</p>
                    <p>Stay safe and have an awesome birthday. May all 
                        your wishes come true!</p>
